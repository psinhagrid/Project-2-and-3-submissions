# Empowering Informed Decisions: Image Captioning and User Query Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on empowering informed decisions through image captioning and user query classification techniques. By combining advanced machine learning models, we aim to provide accurate image descriptions and effectively categorize user queries, thereby enhancing user experience and facilitating better decision-making.

## Features

- Implementation of image captioning and query classification models
- Enhanced user interaction through accurate image descriptions and query categorization
- **Versatile Usage**: This model can be utilized for various applications requiring image understanding and user query processing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/psinhagrid/Project_2_submission.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:  cd Project_2_submission

3. Run : python setup.py install

   
## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebooks:

    - `model_building.ipynb`: Use this notebook to train the image captioning and query classification models.
    - `data_processing.ipynb`: Use this notebook to input images and queries for processing.
    - `test.ipynb`: Use this notebook to test the model with custom prompts.

2. Run each cell in the notebooks sequentially, following the instructions provided in the markdown and code cells.

3. In `test.ipynb`, input custom prompts to test the model's response to specific queries.
